## Project Exam 1
# Travelers blog


![image  ](images/Travelersblog.webp)

  This was my exam project where we got to show everything we have learned this first year of Front-End Developer study. I chose to make a traveler's blog since it matches my lifestyle pretty good these days. 

## Description

On this assignment I chose to focus more on the code then the design. It was the exam and I really wanted to show that I can manage all the things we have learned this year. The design was universal accessibility, wich has been an important thing for me this year since they change the roles in Norway for it. We had to fetch the content for our website to be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. And make an easy to navigate, good looking website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

Under is some of the requirements we had to meet

- Install WordPress on your web host and add the blogs on the admin panel.
- Install Hotjar on your website.
